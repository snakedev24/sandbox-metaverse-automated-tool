# Sandbox Metaverse Automated Tool

## Project Overview

The Sandbox Metaverse Automated Tool is designed to streamline interactions within the Sandbox Metaverse platform. This tool leverages web scraping, automation, and data processing techniques to facilitate various tasks, such as data extraction, manipulation, and automated actions within the metaverse environment.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Scrapes and processes data from the Sandbox Metaverse platform.
- **Automation**: Automates interactions and actions within the Sandbox Metaverse.
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilizes pandas for efficient data handling and manipulation.
- **Clipboard Operations**: Uses pyperclip for clipboard operations.
- **Web Automation**: Employs Selenium for browser automation and interaction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    cd sandbox-metaverse-automated-tool
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash

        ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `beautifulsoup4`: For web scraping and HTML parsing.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
